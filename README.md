### Jitter
![Gracie Meisel](images/LadyBugScreenShot.png?raw=true "Gracie Meisel")

I thought it would be fun to use lady bugs instead of shapes within my Jitter class in order to play with the idea of bugs creeping/jittering around. Although you can't see this in my screen shot, if you click, a magic wand appears. I had a lot of fun with this feature because I always think of making a wish when I see a lady bug (I am quite superstitious).
